# Database Migrations with Alembic

This directory contains database migrations for the API.

## How to Run Migrations

1. Initialize migrations:
   ```
   docker-compose exec api alembic init alembic
   ```

2. Generate a new migration:
   ```
   docker-compose exec api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
   ```

3. Apply migrations:
   ```
   docker-compose exec api alembic upgrade head
   ```

4. Rollback migrations:
   ```
   docker-compose exec api alembic downgrade -1
   ```

5. View migration history:
   ```
   docker-compose exec api alembic history
   ```

## Migration Strategy

- Always create a new migration for each schema change
- Run migrations as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Test migrations with realistic data

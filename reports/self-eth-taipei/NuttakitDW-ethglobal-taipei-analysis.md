## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Security | 6.0/10 | The project uses Google OAuth and TOTP for authentication, which is good. However, secrets are stored in-memory and the `.env.example` file is included, which is a security risk. The Solidity contracts use Ownable from OpenZeppelin, which is a good practice. The ZK verifier contract is complex and requires careful review to ensure its security. |
| Functionality & Correctness | 7.5/10 | The project implements the core functionalities of a zkOTP wallet, including wallet creation, transaction verification using ZK proofs, and recovery mechanisms. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with these functionalities. Mock data is used extensively, indicating that some features are not fully implemented. |
| Readability & Understandability | 7.0/10 | The code is generally well-structured and uses descriptive naming conventions. The frontend components are organized and easy to understand. However, the lack of comprehensive documentation and comments makes it difficult to fully grasp the project's architecture and implementation details. |
| Dependencies & Setup | 6.5/10 | The project uses standard dependency management tools like `npm` and `foundry`. The installation process is relatively straightforward. However, the lack of detailed configuration instructions and deployment considerations makes it difficult to set up and deploy the project in a production environment. |
| Evidence of Technical Usage | 8.0/10 | The project demonstrates a strong understanding of various technologies, including TypeScript, Solidity, Noir, ZK proofs, and frontend frameworks like Next.js and Radix UI. The code includes examples of API design, database interactions, and frontend implementation best practices. However, the lack of tests and CI/CD configuration limits the overall technical quality of the project. |
| **Overall Score** | 6.9/10 | Weighted average |

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal:** The primary goal of this project is to create a privacy-focused cryptocurrency wallet that utilizes Zero-Knowledge One-Time Passwords (zkOTP) for secure transaction verification.
- **Problem solved:** The project aims to address the privacy concerns associated with traditional cryptocurrency wallets by implementing zkOTP, which allows users to verify transactions without revealing sensitive information.
- **Target users/beneficiaries:** The target users are individuals who prioritize privacy and security in their cryptocurrency transactions.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified:** TypeScript, Solidity, JavaScript, Noir
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code:**
    - Frontend: Next.js, React, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Embla Carousel, React Hook Form
    - Backend: Express.js, circomlibjs, @aztec/bb.js, @noir-lang/noir_js, @noir-lang/noir_wasm, ethers
    - Smart Contracts: Solidity, OpenZeppelin
- **Inferred runtime environment(s):** Node.js, Browser, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed:** The project follows a modular structure with separate directories for the frontend, backend APIs, smart contracts, and Noir circuits.
- **Key modules/components and their roles:**
    - `frontend`: Contains the Next.js application for the user interface.
    - `api/google-otp`: Implements Google OAuth and TOTP authentication.
    - `api/self-backend`: Verifies ZK proofs from the frontend using the Self protocol.
    - `api/zkotp`: Generates ZK proofs using Noir and Barretenberg.
    - `contracts`: Contains the Solidity smart contracts for the zkOTP wallet and verifier.
    - `circuit`: Contains the Noir circuits for generating ZK proofs.
- **Code organization assessment:** The code is generally well-organized and follows a consistent structure. However, the lack of comprehensive documentation makes it difficult to fully understand the relationships between different modules and components.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms:** The project uses Google OAuth and TOTP for authentication. The Solidity contracts use Ownable from OpenZeppelin for authorization.
- **Data validation and sanitization:** The frontend components use React Hook Form and Zod for data validation. The backend APIs perform basic input validation.
- **Potential vulnerabilities:**
    - Storing secrets in-memory is a security risk.
    - The `.env.example` file includes sensitive information, which should be removed.
    - The ZK verifier contract is complex and requires careful review to ensure its security.
    - The project lacks proper input sanitization, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Secret management approach:** The project uses environment variables to store secrets. However, the `.env.example` file is included, which is a security risk. A more secure secret management approach should be implemented, such as using a dedicated secret management service.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented:**
    - Wallet creation
    - Transaction verification using ZK proofs
    - Recovery mechanisms
    - Frontend user interface
- **Error handling approach:** The code includes basic error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks and error messages.
- **Edge case handling:** The code includes some edge case handling, such as validating input values and preventing replay attacks.
- **Testing strategy:** The project includes some frontend tests using Jest and React Testing Library. However, the lack of comprehensive tests for the backend APIs and smart contracts is a major concern.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency:** The code generally follows a consistent style guide.
- **Documentation quality:** The project lacks comprehensive documentation and comments, making it difficult to fully understand the architecture and implementation details.
- **Naming conventions:** The code uses descriptive naming conventions, which improves readability.
- **Complexity management:** The project uses a modular structure to manage complexity. However, the ZK verifier contract is complex and requires careful review.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach:** The project uses standard dependency management tools like `npm` and `foundry`.
- **Installation process:** The installation process is relatively straightforward.
- **Configuration approach:** The project uses environment variables for configuration.
- **Deployment considerations:** The project lacks detailed deployment instructions and considerations.

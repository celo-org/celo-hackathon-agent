## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Security | 6.0/10 | The project uses AccessControl and ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin, which are good practices. However, the README explicitly states that the contracts are unaudited, and there's no clear input validation or sanitization in the provided code snippets. The use of a mock price feed is also a security concern. |
| Functionality & Correctness | 7.5/10 | The core functionalities of CDP management, stability pool, and swapping seem to be implemented. The code includes logic for calculating interest, collateral ratios, and liquidation prices. However, there's a lack of comprehensive testing, and edge case handling isn't explicitly demonstrated in the provided snippets. |
| Readability & Understandability | 7.0/10 | The code is generally well-structured and uses descriptive naming conventions. The README provides a good overview of the project and its components. However, there's a lack of inline comments and detailed documentation for individual functions and modules. |
| Dependencies & Setup | 8.0/10 | The project uses npm for dependency management and provides clear instructions for installation and setup. The use of Docker and docker-compose simplifies the deployment process. The .env.example file provides a good starting point for configuration. |
| Evidence of Technical Usage | 7.5/10 | The project demonstrates good use of frameworks and libraries like Next.js, NestJS, ethers, and Prisma. The smart contracts are well-structured and follow common Solidity patterns. The frontend implementation uses React components and state management effectively. However, there's room for improvement in areas like query optimization and caching strategies. |
| **Overall Score** | 7.2/10 | Weighted average |

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal:** The ZEST Protocol aims to create a Bitcoin-native stablecoin ecosystem on the Citrea network.
- **Problem solved:** It addresses the need for a decentralized, USD-pegged stablecoin collateralized by cBTC, leveraging Bitcoin's security and Citrea's scalability.
- **Target users/beneficiaries:** Target users include DeFi participants seeking a stablecoin alternative, Bitcoin holders looking to earn yield, and developers building financial applications on Citrea.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified:** TypeScript, Solidity, CSS, JavaScript, Dockerfile
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code:**
    - Backend: NestJS, Prisma, ethers, Bull, @selfxyz/core, class-validator, class-transformer, Swagger
    - Frontend: Next.js, React, RainbowKit, Wagmi, @tanstack/react-query, lucide-react, tailwind-merge, tw-animate-css, use-debounce, @yudiel/react-qr-scanner, qrcode.react, sonner
    - Smart Contracts: Solidity, OpenZeppelin contracts, Foundry
- **Inferred runtime environment(s):** Node.js, Docker, EVM-compatible blockchain (Citrea)

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed:** The project follows a modular structure with separate directories for the backend, frontend, and smart contracts (dapp).
- **Key modules/components and their roles:**
    - `backend`: Contains the NestJS API, Prisma database models, and blockchain interaction logic.
    - `frontend`: Implements the user interface using Next.js and React.
    - `dapp`: Houses the Solidity smart contracts and deployment scripts.
- **Code organization assessment:** The code is generally well-organized, with clear separation of concerns between the different modules. The use of NestJS and Next.js provides a structured framework for building the backend and frontend, respectively.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms:** The smart contracts use AccessControl from OpenZeppelin for role-based access control. The backend relies on wallet connection through Wagmi and RainbowKit.
- **Data validation and sanitization:** The backend uses class-validator for validating input data in DTOs. However, there's no clear evidence of sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- **Potential vulnerabilities:**
    - The contracts are unaudited, which poses a significant security risk.
    - The use of a mock price feed in the `BlockchainService` is a potential vulnerability, as it could be manipulated to trigger liquidations or other unintended consequences.
    - The lack of comprehensive input validation and sanitization could lead to injection attacks.
- **Secret management approach:** The project uses environment variables to store sensitive information like private keys and API keys. However, the .env.example file is included in the repository, which is a security risk.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented:** The project implements core functionalities such as CDP management, stability pool deposits and withdrawals, and token swapping.
- **Error handling approach:** The code includes basic error handling using try-catch blocks and `require` statements. The backend uses toast notifications to display error messages to the user.
- **Edge case handling:** The code includes some basic edge case handling, such as checking for zero amounts and sufficient collateral. However, there's a lack of comprehensive testing to ensure that all edge cases are handled correctly.
- **Testing strategy:** The project includes a basic e2e test for the backend and some unit tests. However, there's a lack of comprehensive testing for the smart contracts and frontend components.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency:** The code generally follows a consistent style, with clear naming conventions and indentation. The use of Prettier and ESLint helps to enforce code style consistency.
- **Documentation quality:** The README provides a good overview of the project and its components. However, there's a lack of inline comments and detailed documentation for individual functions and modules.
- **Naming conventions:** The code uses descriptive naming conventions for variables, functions, and modules.
- **Complexity management:** The project uses a modular structure to manage complexity. The use of frameworks and libraries like NestJS and Next.js provides a structured framework for building the backend and frontend, respectively.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach:** The project uses npm for dependency management.
- **Installation process:** The README provides clear instructions for installing the project and its dependencies.
- **Configuration approach:** The project uses environment variables for configuration. The .env.example file provides a good starting point for configuration.
- **Deployment considerations:** The project includes Docker and docker-compose files, which simplifies the deployment process.

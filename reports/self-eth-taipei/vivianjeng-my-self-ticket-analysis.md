## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Security | 6.5/10 | Authentication relies on passport number and date of birth, which could be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.  Environment variables are used, but secret management isn't explicitly addressed.  The contract verification uses a private key stored in an environment variable, which is a security risk. |
| Functionality & Correctness | 7.5/10 | Core functionalities like event browsing, ticket purchasing, and ticket verification are implemented.  Error handling is present, but edge case handling and testing strategy are unclear. |
| Readability & Understandability | 8.0/10 | Code style is generally consistent, and naming conventions are reasonable. Documentation is present in the README, but more in-code comments would be beneficial. |
| Dependencies & Setup | 8.5/10 | Dependencies are managed using `yarn`.  The installation process is well-defined in the README. Configuration is done through environment variables. |
| Evidence of Technical Usage | 8.0/10 | The project demonstrates good use of Next.js, Prisma, and the Self Protocol SDK. API design follows RESTful principles. Database interactions are handled using Prisma ORM. |
| **Overall Score** | 7.6/10 | Weighted average considering all factors. |

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal:** The project aims to create a ticket selling platform that utilizes the Self Protocol for secure and privacy-preserving ticket verification, preventing scalping and bot purchases.
- **Problem solved:** Addresses the privacy concerns associated with traditional real-name registration for concert tickets by using Zero-Knowledge proofs to verify identity without revealing sensitive information.
- **Target users/beneficiaries:** Concert attendees, event organizers, and ticketing platforms seeking a more secure and privacy-respecting ticket verification process.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified:** TypeScript, CSS, JavaScript
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code:** Next.js, React, Prisma, Self Protocol SDK, Celo, Polygon, Stripe, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth
- **Inferred runtime environment(s):** Node.js, Vercel (based on `next.config.ts` and deployment mentions)

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed:** The project follows a standard Next.js structure with pages under the `src/app` directory, API routes under `src/app/api`, and components under `src/components`.
- **Key modules/components and their roles:**
    - `src/app/page.tsx`: Home page displaying upcoming events.
    - `src/app/events/[id]/page.tsx`: Event details page with seat selection.
    - `src/app/events/[id]/qr/page.tsx`: QR code generation for ticket verification.
    - `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`: Authentication using NextAuth and Prisma.
    - `src/app/api/create-ticket/route.ts`: API endpoint for creating tickets.
    - `src/app/api/events/[id]/route.ts`: API endpoint for fetching event details.
    - `src/app/api/verify/route.ts`: API endpoint for verifying Self Protocol proofs.
    - `src/app/api/verify-ticket/[id]/route.ts`: API endpoint for verifying tickets using Self Protocol.
    - `src/components/SeatSelection.tsx`: Component for selecting seats.
    - `src/components/PaymentForm.tsx`: Component for handling payments with Stripe.
- **Code organization assessment:** The code is reasonably well-organized, with clear separation of concerns between components, API routes, and data access logic.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms:** Authentication is handled using NextAuth with a custom credentials provider that verifies passport number and date of birth against the database.
- **Data validation and sanitization:** Limited explicit data validation is observed. The `api/create-ticket` route checks for the existence of `eventId` and `ticketIds` and verifies that `ticketIds` is an array.
- **Potential vulnerabilities:**
    - **Brute-force attacks:** The authentication mechanism is vulnerable to brute-force attacks since it relies on passport number and date of birth.  Hashing the date of birth would improve security.
    - **Private key exposure:** The `api/verify` route uses a private key stored in an environment variable to sign transactions. This is a major security risk and should be replaced with a more secure key management solution.
    - **Lack of input validation:** Insufficient input validation in API routes could lead to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Secret management approach:** Secrets are managed using environment variables, which is a basic approach.  A more robust solution like a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) is recommended for production environments.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented:**
    - User authentication using Self Protocol and passport information.
    - Event browsing and display.
    - Seat selection and ticket purchasing.
    - Ticket verification using Self Protocol.
- **Error handling approach:** Error handling is implemented using `try...catch` blocks in API routes and components.  Error messages are logged to the console and returned in the response.
- **Edge case handling:** Edge case handling is limited. For example, the seat selection component limits the number of seats that can be selected, but more comprehensive validation is needed.
- **Testing strategy:** No explicit testing strategy is mentioned or visible in the code.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency:** Code style is generally consistent, adhering to common TypeScript and JavaScript conventions.
- **Documentation quality:** Documentation is present in the README file, providing an overview of the project and setup instructions.  However, more in-code comments would improve understandability.
- **Naming conventions:** Naming conventions are reasonable and consistent throughout the codebase.
- **Complexity management:** The code is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach:** Dependencies are managed using `yarn`.
- **Installation process:** The installation process is well-defined in the README file, providing clear instructions for installing dependencies, setting up the database, and starting the development server.
- **Configuration approach:** Configuration is done through environment variables.
- **Deployment considerations:** The README mentions Vercel, suggesting that the project is designed to be deployed on Vercel.

## Evidence of Technical Usage
1. **Framework/Library Integration:**
   - Correct usage of Next.js for routing, API endpoints, and server-side rendering.
   - Effective use of Prisma for database interactions, including schema definition, data seeding, and querying.
   - Proper integration of the Self Protocol SDK for generating QR codes and verifying proofs.
   - Utilization of Tailwind CSS for styling and UI components.
   - Implementation of NextAuth for authentication.

2. **API Design and Implementation:**
   - RESTful API design with clear endpoint organization (e.g., `/api/events/[id]`, `/api/create-ticket`).
   - Proper request/response handling with appropriate HTTP status codes.

3. **Database Interactions:**
   - Data model design using Prisma schema.
   - Efficient querying using Prisma's query builder.

4. **Frontend Implementation:**
   - UI component structure using React and Tailwind CSS.
   - State management using React's `useState` hook.
   - Usage of `next/link` for client-side navigation.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Usage of `Suspense` for lazy loading components.
   - Asynchronous operations using `async/await`.

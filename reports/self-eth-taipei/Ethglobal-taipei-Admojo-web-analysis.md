## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Security | 6.5/10 | Uses Privy for auth, but details on secret management and data validation are limited. Potential vulnerabilities in Metal API integration need further investigation. |
| Functionality & Correctness | 7.8/10 | Core functionalities are implemented, but some features are still under development.  Error handling is present, but edge case handling and testing are limited. |
| Readability & Understandability | 8.0/10 | Code is generally well-structured and uses clear naming conventions. README provides a good overview, but dedicated documentation is missing. |
| Dependencies & Setup | 7.0/10 | Dependencies are managed with package.json. Installation process is standard. Configuration relies on environment variables. Deployment considerations are not fully addressed. |
| Evidence of Technical Usage | 8.2/10 | Demonstrates good framework/library integration (Next.js, TailwindCSS, Prisma, viem). API design is present, and database interactions are handled with Prisma. |
| **Overall Score** | 7.4/10 |  Weighted average based on the individual criteria scores. |

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal:** AdNet Protocol aims to create a decentralized advertising platform connecting advertisers and display providers using blockchain technology.
- **Problem solved:** Addresses issues of transparency, accountability, and fraud in traditional advertising.
- **Target users/beneficiaries:** Advertisers, display providers, and end-users.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified:** TypeScript, Solidity, JavaScript, CSS, Shell
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code:** Next.js, TailwindCSS, Prisma, viem, Socket.IO, Privy Wallet, @selfxyz/core
- **Inferred runtime environment(s):** Node.js, potentially serverless environments (Vercel, Netlify)

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed:** Monorepo structure with web frontend and smart contracts.
- **Key modules/components and their roles:**
    - `src/app`: Next.js frontend application
    - `admojo-contracts`: Solidity smart contracts
    - `prisma`: Database schema and migrations
- **Code organization assessment:** Generally well-organized, but could benefit from more modularization and separation of concerns in the frontend.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms:** Uses Privy Wallet for authentication.  Authorization is implemented in smart contracts using `onlyOwnerOrAdmin` and `onlyCampaignOwner` modifiers.
- **Data validation and sanitization:** Limited evidence of robust data validation and sanitization.  The reliance on `JSON.parse` in some areas could introduce vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Potential vulnerabilities could arise from insecure handling of API keys, lack of input validation, and reliance on external APIs (Metal API).
- **Secret management approach:** Relies on environment variables for storing secrets. This approach is acceptable for development but needs to be improved for production environments (e.g., using a secrets management service).

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented:** User authentication, campaign creation, location management, payment processing, and analytics.
- **Error handling approach:** Uses `try...catch` blocks for error handling.  Error messages are displayed to the user using the `toast` utility.
- **Edge case handling:** Limited evidence of comprehensive edge case handling.
- **Testing strategy:** Limited test suite implementation.  The smart contracts have some tests, but the frontend lacks dedicated tests.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency:** Code style is generally consistent, using TypeScript and following common JavaScript conventions.
- **Documentation quality:** README provides a good overview of the project.  However, there is no dedicated documentation directory, and contribution guidelines are missing.
- **Naming conventions:** Naming conventions are generally clear and consistent.
- **Complexity management:** Complexity is managed reasonably well, but some components could benefit from further refactoring and modularization.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach:** Dependencies are managed using `package.json` and `pnpm`.
- **Installation process:** Standard `pnpm install` process.
- **Configuration approach:** Configuration relies on environment variables.
- **Deployment considerations:** Deployment considerations are not fully addressed.  The project lacks containerization (e.g., Dockerfile) and detailed deployment instructions.

## Evidence of Technical Usage

1. **Framework/Library Integration:**
   - Correct usage of Next.js, TailwindCSS, Prisma, viem, and other libraries.
   - Follows framework-specific best practices.
   - Architecture patterns are appropriate for the technologies used.

2. **API Design and Implementation:**
   - RESTful API design is used for backend endpoints.
   - Proper endpoint organization.
   - Request/response handling is implemented.

3. **Database Interactions:**
   - Data model design is well-defined using Prisma.
   - ORM usage with Prisma.
   - Database migrations are used for schema management.

4. **Frontend Implementation:**
   - UI component structure is well-organized using React components.
   - State management is implemented using Zustand.
   - Responsive design is achieved using TailwindCSS.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Caching strategies are implemented using `localStorage`.
   - Asynchronous operations are used for blockchain interactions.

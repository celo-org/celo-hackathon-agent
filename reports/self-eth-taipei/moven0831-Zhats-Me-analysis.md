## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal:** The project aims to create a web application for ETHGlobal Taipei 2025 that verifies user identity and event tickets using the Self protocol and ZK-Email proofs.
- **Problem solved:** It addresses the need for secure and privacy-preserving verification of identity and ticket ownership for event attendees.
- **Target users/beneficiaries:** ETHGlobal Taipei 2025 attendees and event organizers.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified:** TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code:** Next.js, React, `@selfxyz/core`, `@selfxyz/qrcode`, `@zk-email/sdk`, `nodemailer`, `@vercel/kv`
- **Inferred runtime environment(s):** Node.js, Browser

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed:** A Next.js application with a clear separation of concerns. The `src/app` directory contains the route handlers and page components, while `src/components` houses reusable UI components. The `src/lib` directory contains utility functions for email handling, verification, and data storage.
- **Key modules/components and their roles:**
    - `README.md`: Provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including features, prerequisites, setup instructions, and troubleshooting tips.
    - `src/app/page.tsx`: The main page component that orchestrates the identity and ticket verification process.
    - `src/components/SelfQRCode.tsx`: A component that displays a QR code for identity verification using the Self protocol.
    - `src/components/ZkEmailVerifier.tsx`: A component that handles the verification of email tickets using the ZK-Email SDK.
    - `src/app/api/send-verification/route.ts`, `src/app/api/test-email-config/route.ts`, `src/app/api/verify/route.ts`, `src/app/api/verify/status/route.ts`, `src/app/api/verify-token/route.ts`: API routes for handling email verification, proof verification, and status retrieval.
    - `src/lib/email.ts`: Contains utility functions for sending and verifying emails.
    - `src/lib/verification.ts`: Contains utility functions for verifying proofs using the Self protocol and ZK-Email SDK.
    - `src/lib/store-verification.ts`: Contains utility functions for storing verification results in a shared KV store.
    - `src/lib/context/EventContext.tsx`: React Context for managing the selected event.
- **Code organization assessment:** The code is well-organized and follows a modular structure, making it easy to understand and maintain. The use of dynamic imports for the Self QR code and ZkEmail components helps to improve performance by reducing the initial load time.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms:** The project uses a token-based authentication system for email verification. However, there are no explicit authorization mechanisms in place to restrict access to certain functionalities based on user roles or permissions.
- **Data validation and sanitization:** The project performs basic email format validation, but it lacks comprehensive data validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
- **Potential vulnerabilities:**
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The project may be vulnerable to XSS attacks if user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the UI.
    - **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The project may be vulnerable to IDOR attacks if the verification status endpoint does not properly validate the user ID before returning the verification result.
    - **Email Spoofing:** While the project uses an app password, it's still possible for attackers to spoof emails if the email configuration is not properly secured.
- **Secret management approach:** The project uses environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys and email credentials. However, it does not explicitly address the secure management of these secrets in a production environment.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented:**
    - Identity verification using the Self protocol
    - Ticket verification using the ZK-Email SDK
    - Email verification using a token-based system
- **Error handling approach:** The project uses `try...catch` blocks to handle errors and provides user-friendly error messages. However, the error handling could be improved by providing more specific error messages and logging errors for debugging purposes.
- **Edge case handling:** The project handles some edge cases, such as invalid email formats and expired tokens. However, it may not handle all possible edge cases, such as malformed email files or invalid ZK-Email proofs.
- **Testing strategy:** The project lacks a dedicated test suite, which makes it difficult to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency:** The code follows a consistent code style, making it easy to read and understand.
- **Documentation quality:** The README file provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including features, prerequisites, setup instructions, and troubleshooting tips. However, the code itself lacks detailed comments and documentation.
- **Naming conventions:** The project uses clear and descriptive naming conventions for variables, functions, and components.
- **Complexity management:** The code is well-structured and follows a modular design, making it easy to understand and maintain. The use of dynamic imports helps to reduce the initial load time and improve performance.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach:** The project uses `pnpm` to manage dependencies, which is a modern and efficient package manager.
- **Installation process:** The installation process is clearly documented in the README file and involves cloning the repository, installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, and starting the development server.
- **Configuration approach:** The project uses environment variables to configure the application, which is a best practice for managing sensitive information and adapting the application to different environments.
- **Deployment considerations:** The project includes a `vercel.json` file, which indicates that it is designed to be deployed on Vercel. The file specifies the build command, install command, and framework, making it easy to deploy the application.

## Evidence of Technical Usage

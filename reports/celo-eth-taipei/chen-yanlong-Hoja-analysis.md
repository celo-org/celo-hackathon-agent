## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Security | 6.5/10 | Uses ZKPs and Semaphore for privacy, but lacks comprehensive security audits, formal verification, and input sanitization. |
| Functionality & Correctness | 7.5/10 | Core functionalities are implemented, but the ZKP generation is simulated, and edge case handling and testing are missing. |
| Readability & Understandability | 8.0/10 | Code is generally well-structured and uses clear naming conventions, but could benefit from more detailed documentation. |
| Dependencies & Setup | 7.0/10 | Dependencies are managed with npm, but the setup process and configuration approach could be improved with more detailed instructions and examples. |
| Evidence of Celo Usage | 6.0/10 | Mentions Celo in the README and PaymentModal, but the actual Celo integration is limited to selecting Celo as a payment network and interacting with a mock USDC contract. |
| **Overall Score** | 7.0/10 | Weighted average, considering the importance of security and Celo integration. |

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal in the Celo ecosystem:** Hoja aims to build a food ordering and review platform that ensures authenticity by allowing only paying customers to leave reviews, leveraging blockchain payments and ZK-proofs for privacy.
- **Problem solved for Celo users/developers:** It addresses the issue of fake or biased reviews by verifying reviewers' purchase history using blockchain technology and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
- **Target users/beneficiaries within web3/blockchain space:** Restaurants, food reviewers, and crypto users who value authentic reviews and privacy.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified:** TypeScript, CSS, JavaScript
- **Key blockchain frameworks and libraries (especially Celo-related):** ethers.js, viem, wagmi, @selfxyz/core
- **Smart contract standards and patterns used:** ERC-20 (USDC simulation)
- **Frontend/backend technologies:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure:** The project follows a Next.js structure with components, pages, hooks, and UI elements.
- **Key components and their interactions:**
    - Frontend: React components for restaurant listings, menus, reviews, cart management, and wallet connection.
    - Backend: Next.js API route (`/api/verify`) for verifying Self Protocol proofs.
    - Blockchain: Interaction with Polygon and Celo for payments (simulated).
- **Smart contract architecture (if applicable):** The project interacts with a mock USDC contract on Polygon and Celo. The `abi.ts` file contains the ABI for a smart contract used for birthday verification.
- **Frontend-backend integration approach:** The frontend interacts with the backend API route (`/api/verify`) to verify Self Protocol proofs.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms:** Wallet-based authentication using MetaMask.
- **Smart contract security patterns:** The project uses ZKPs and Semaphore for privacy.
- **Input validation and sanitization:** Lacks comprehensive input validation and sanitization.
- **Private key and wallet security:** Relies on MetaMask for wallet security. The backend API uses a private key stored in environment variables, which is a security risk.
- **Transaction security:** Transactions are processed on Polygon and Celo, but the actual payment implementation is simulated.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented:** Restaurant listings, menu display, cart management, wallet connection, and review submission.
- **Smart contract correctness:** The project interacts with a mock USDC contract, so smart contract correctness is not fully tested.
- **Error handling approach:** Basic error handling with alerts and console logs.
- **Edge case handling:** Lacks comprehensive edge case handling.
- **Testing strategy:** No tests are included in the code digest.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency:** Consistent code style using Prettier and ESLint.
- **Documentation quality:** README provides a high-level overview of the project, but lacks detailed documentation.
- **Naming conventions:** Clear and consistent naming conventions.
- **Complexity management:** The project is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach:** npm is used for dependency management.
- **Installation process:** The README provides basic installation instructions.
- **Configuration approach:** Configuration is done through environment variables.
- **Deployment considerations for Celo:** The project can be deployed to Celo using a Celo-compatible RPC endpoint.

## Evidence of Celo Usage
1. **Celo SDK Integration**
   - No direct Celo SDK integration found.
   - Celo provider configuration: `pages/api/verify.ts` connects to the Celo Alfajores testnet using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org/")`.
   - References to Celo keywords: "Celo" is mentioned in `README.md` and `components/PaymentModal.tsx`.

2. **Celo Smart Contracts**
   - Interaction with Celo core contracts: Interacts with a mock USDC contract on Celo.
   - Use of Celo tokens: Mentions CELO and cUSD in the context of payment options.
   - Contract Addresses: Contract address `0x3c0EB6B70214447DC9Da98166caDb067Eb185a7d` is found in `pages/api/verify.ts`. This is likely the address of the deployed birthday verification contract on Celo Alfajores.
   - Contract address `0x2F25deB3848C207fc8E0c34035B3Ba7fC157602B` is found in `components/PaymentModal.tsx`. This is likely the address of the deployed USDC contract on Celo Alfajores.

3. **Celo Features**
   - No specific Celo features like identity attestations or phone number verification are used directly, but Self Protocol integration could be extended to leverage Celo's identity layer.

4. **Celo DeFi Elements**
   - No integration with Mento or other Celo DeFi protocols.

5. **Mobile-First Approach**
   - The project uses responsive design principles, but there is no specific optimization for mobile users.

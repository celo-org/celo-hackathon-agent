## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Security | 6.5/10 | Uses ZK proofs via Self Protocol, but lacks comprehensive security measures like input sanitization and rate limiting. Private key management is also a concern. |
| Functionality & Correctness | 7.5/10 | Core functionalities are implemented, but some features are marked as "WIP". Error handling is present but could be more robust. No tests are included. |
| Readability & Understandability | 8.0/10 | Code is generally well-structured and uses clear naming conventions. Documentation is present in the README, but could be more detailed. |
| Dependencies & Setup | 7.0/10 | Dependencies are managed using `yarn`. Setup instructions are provided, but lack detailed configuration examples. |
| Evidence of Celo Usage | 6.0/10 | The project utilizes Celo for on-chain verification of ZK proofs and mentions Celo contract addresses in the README.md file. However, the integration is limited to contract interaction and doesn't fully leverage Celo's unique features. |
| **Overall Score** | 7.0/10 | A functional application leveraging ZK proofs and blockchain, but with room for improvement in security, testing, and Celo integration. |

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal in the Celo ecosystem:** The primary goal is to prevent ticket scalping and bot purchases by using the Self Protocol for identity verification and Celo for on-chain ZK-proof verification.
- **Problem solved for Celo users/developers:** Addresses the privacy concerns of real-name registration for event tickets by using ZK-proofs for identity verification.
- **Target users/beneficiaries within web3/blockchain space:** Concert attendees, event organizers, and developers interested in privacy-preserving identity verification solutions.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified:** TypeScript, CSS, JavaScript
- **Key blockchain frameworks and libraries (especially Celo-related):** ethers.js (for interacting with Celo), @selfxyz/core, @selfxyz/qrcode
- **Smart contract standards and patterns used:** The project interacts with a smart contract deployed on Celo, but the contract code itself is in a separate repository.
- **Frontend/backend technologies:** Next.js (React framework), Prisma (ORM), PostgreSQL

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure:** A Next.js application with API routes for handling authentication, ticket creation, and verification.
- **Key components and their interactions:**
    - Frontend: React components for displaying events, seat selection, and QR code scanning.
    - Backend: API routes for interacting with the database, Self Protocol, and Celo blockchain.
    - Database: PostgreSQL database for storing user, event, and ticket data.
- **Smart contract architecture (if applicable):** The smart contract architecture is not directly visible in this code digest, but it is mentioned as being in a separate repository. The contract is used for verifying ZK-proofs.
- **Frontend-backend integration approach:** API routes are used to connect the frontend with the backend logic, including database interactions and blockchain interactions.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms:** NextAuth.js is used for authentication, with a custom credentials provider that verifies passport number and date of birth.
- **Smart contract security patterns:** The security of the smart contract is not directly analyzable from this code digest, as the contract code is in a separate repository.
- **Input validation and sanitization:** Limited input validation is present. The API routes check for the presence of required parameters, but lack comprehensive sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- **Private key and wallet security:** The `PRIVATE_KEY` is stored as an environment variable, which is not ideal for production environments. A more secure solution, such as using a hardware wallet or a key management service, should be considered.
- **Transaction security:** Transactions are signed using ethers.js, but there's no explicit handling of transaction failures or reverts.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented:**
    - User authentication using passport number and date of birth.
    - Displaying a list of events with available seats.
    - Seat selection and ticket purchasing.
    - QR code generation for ticket verification.
    - ZK-proof verification using Self Protocol and Celo blockchain.
- **Smart contract correctness:** The correctness of the smart contract cannot be determined from this code digest.
- **Error handling approach:** Error handling is present in the API routes, but could be more robust. The code catches exceptions and returns error responses, but lacks detailed logging and monitoring.
- **Edge case handling:** Limited edge case handling is present. For example, the seat selection component limits the number of seats that can be selected, but doesn't handle cases where all seats are already taken.
- **Testing strategy:** No tests are included in the code digest.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency:** The code generally follows consistent coding style conventions.
- **Documentation quality:** The README provides a high-level overview of the project, but lacks detailed documentation for the individual components and API routes.
- **Naming conventions:** The code uses clear and descriptive naming conventions.
- **Complexity management:** The code is relatively well-structured and avoids excessive complexity.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach:** Dependencies are managed using `yarn`.
- **Installation process:** The README provides clear instructions for installing dependencies and setting up the database.
- **Configuration approach:** The project uses environment variables for configuration.
- **Deployment considerations for Celo:** The project requires a Celo node endpoint and a deployed smart contract on the Celo network.

## Evidence of Celo Usage
1. **Celo SDK Integration**
   - No direct usage of `@celo` packages is found.
   - Celo provider configuration is present in `/src/app/api/verify/route.ts` using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL)`.
   - Connection to Celo networks (Mainnet, Alfajores) is implied by the contract addresses in `README.md`.
   - References to Celo keywords like "celo" are found in `README.md`.
   - Celo Contract interaction in `/src/app/api/verify/route.ts`

2. **Celo Smart Contracts**
   - Interaction with Celo core contracts is not evident.
   - Use of Celo tokens (CELO, cUSD, cEUR, cREAL) is not evident.
   - Implementation of Celo-specific standards is not evident.
   - **Contract Addresses**:
     - **README.md Contains Celo Contract Addresses:**
       - `0xf4205f466de67ca37d820504eb3c81bb89081214`
       - `0x9c060e2200df127cab5e3d5cc5824292604c1391`
       - `0xdff0e2480a9528a2cd7a482c492b42510feeec4d`
       - `0x62f114d7aa792864c2ce340c4b03f967c94de6e4`
       - `0xe76f72f976913db1ace6b127f60dc2ab10c60633`

3. **Celo Features**
   - No evidence of identity attestations, phone number verification, stable token mechanisms, validator operations, or governance participation.

4. **Celo DeFi Elements**
   - No integration with Mento, Celo Reserve, or other Celo DeFi protocols.

5. **Mobile-First Approach**
   - The project uses the Self Protocol, which is designed for mobile devices.

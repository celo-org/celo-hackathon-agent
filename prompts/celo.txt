## Evidence of Celo Usage
Look for specific evidence of Celo integration, such as:

1. **Celo SDK Integration**
   - Use of @celo packages (contractkit, wallet-base, etc.)
   - Celo provider configuration
   - Connection to Celo networks (Mainnet, Alfajores, Baklava)

2. **Celo Smart Contracts**
   - Interaction with Celo core contracts
   - Use of Celo tokens (CELO, cUSD, cEUR, cREAL)
   - Implementation of Celo-specific standards

3. **Celo Features**
   - Identity attestations
   - Phone number verification
   - Stable token mechanisms
   - Validator operations
   - Governance participation

4. **Celo DeFi Elements**
   - Integration with Mento (Celo's stability mechanism)
   - Use of Celo Reserve
   - Interaction with Celo DeFi protocols (Ubeswap, Moola, etc.)

5. **Mobile-First Approach**
   - Lightweight client implementations
   - Mobile wallet integration
   - Optimization for mobile users

Score this section based on the depth and quality of Celo integration. Projects with superficial Celo usage should score lower than those with deep integration.

## Suggestions & Next Steps
- 3-5 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement
- Potential integration with other Celo projects/protocols
- Future development directions in the Celo ecosystem
